# End-to-End-Object-Detection
This open source repository contains example end-to-end workflow for object detection analytics.
1. Dataset preprocessing using FiftyOne [BACKLOG]
2. Reproducible Trainer Object Detection using Ultralytics (YoloV8) [BACKLOG]
3. Inference Engine using OnnxRuntime and TensorRT [BACKLOG]
4. Model Performance Analysis (xAI) [BACKLOG]
5. Active Learning for Object Detection [BACKLOG]

# Example Use Case
In this open source project, we will do Bottle Defect Detection for manufacture.
